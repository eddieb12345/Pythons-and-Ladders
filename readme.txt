Store any code you want to be able to share easily here. 

For help on setting up github, read this article:

In the article it says to use git push, however I had to use git push origin master.

To create your own folders, use mkdir for the first one and drag and drop into it.
You can then add, commit and push as normal.

All code editing is done offline as normal, but when you are finished you can push it
all to save it online. If you are editing code with someone else, remember to pull at
the start of a session to get the most up to date version.
